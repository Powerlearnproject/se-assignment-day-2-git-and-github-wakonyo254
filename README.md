## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
a) Repository -This is a folder that stores all the project files and helps track the evolution of the projects.
b) Commit - This is helps in saving changes made in a project.
c) Branch - This is  a separate workspace within the main project.
d) Merge - This is the process of combining changes from one branch into another
Github is a popular tool for managing version of code as it provides several features that makes it easier to work on software projects.
Version control helps maintain project intergrity as it tracks all changes made in a project and store the entire project history.

## Describe the process of setting up a new repository on GitHub. What are the key steps involved, and what are some of the important decisions you need to make during this process?
a) Create a github account - Go to GitHub.com and sign up for an account
b)Log in to your Github using your credentials
c) Create a new repository - Click on the new repository icon and fill in the required details
d) Initialize with a README - This option helps yu to create agood place to write a summary of your project
Some important decisions you need to make includes
a) Consider whether you want a public or private repository
b) Include a license if necessary
c) Consider if you need a branch repository

## Discuss the importance of the README file in a GitHub repository. What should be included in a well-written README, and how does it contribute to effective collaboration?
a) First impression - It provides an overview of your project
b) Guidance for user - It offers a guide on how the project was/ is done
c) Documentation - Helps in documenting your project
A well-written README should contain project name, description of the project, installation guide , features providede by the project and instruction on how to configure the project
## Compare and contrast the differences between a public repository and a private repository on GitHub. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each, particularly in the context of collaborative projects?
A public repository is visible to everyone on the internet and anyone can contribute while a private repository is only visible to the owner ond specific colaborators who have gained access.
ADVANTAGES
Public repository encourages contributions from a broad community hence enhances the connection with other developers
Private repository allows you to keep your work secure 
DISADVANTAGES
public repository lacks privacy hence some important projects could be stolen by others
private repository cuts down the chances of the help from a broader community
## Detail the steps involved in making your first commit to a GitHub repository. What are commits, and how do they help in tracking changes and managing different versions of your project?
a) Open your new repository on github and go to readme file
b) Make changes or work on your project as desired
c) After you are through click on the commit button
Commit is a feature on github that captures the state of your project every moment. Every time you commit, Git records a new version of your project hence creating a timeline that allows you to see your project evolution.
## How does branching work in Git, and why is it an important feature for collaborative development on GitHub? Discuss the process of creating, using, and merging branches in a typical workflow.
Branching allows you to create a separate line of development within your project where you can work without affecting the main branch.
Branching is important as it helps keep the main branch stable and free of unfinished code.
a) Create a branch by simply telling Git to copy the main trunk at its current state.
b) Make the neccessary changes by adding new code or fixing bugs.
c) Commit your work and save as you progress
d) merge the branch with the main branch after you are content about your work. Switch to the main branch and merge it with the other branche

## Explore the role of pull requests in the GitHub workflow. How do they facilitate code review and collaboration, and what are the typical steps involved in creating and merging a pull request?
Pull requests enables version control system track changes. Pull requests provide a space where developers can discuss proposed changes and also reveiwers can comment directly within the code change

## Discuss the concept of "forking" a repository on GitHub. How does forking differ from cloning, and what are some scenarios where forking would be particularly useful?
Forkinn is
## Examine the importance of issues and project boards on GitHub. How can they be used to track bugs, manage tasks, and improve project organization? Provide examples of how these tools can enhance collaborative efforts.

## Reflect on common challenges and best practices associated with using GitHub for version control. What are some common pitfalls new users might encounter, and what strategies can be employed to overcome them and ensure smooth collaboration?
